there are two patterns of authentication 

One is stateful and the other is stateless
Stateful is the one which maintains state or data or the server side 

Example- parking me ticket leke car rakhke wapas ticket deke apna gaadi leta hai
gaadi ko jaise hi ticket dikhake wo banda leke jayega waisehi wo apne diary se infos delete krdega


Example client gives its username and password to the server nd gets a unique session id server uska track rkhta hai
Ab usko aona id dikhana hoga

Stateless is the one which has no state
