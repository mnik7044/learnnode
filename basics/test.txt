We can deliberately install the version of any package by following the given syntax.
npm install <package-name>@versin which I want to install

We can get to know about the versions from npmjs.com

"express": "^4.18.2"

Here the charAt symbol or the symbol ^👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻 means that npm can update the minor and recommended fixes but avoid installing the risky fixes like for example
if the new version is 4.18.3 it will install even if the new update is 4.19.1 it will install and update but will not update if the latest version is 
5.0.0
